import pandas as pd

# 1. Load cleaned datasets


# 2. Rename 'crypturl' to 'url' in the valid tokens dataset


# 3. Assign labels


# 4. Drop any extra columns to keep only one 'url' column in both
#    (valid dataset had no 'url' originally, scams dataset has 'url' already)
#    Ensure both dataframes have identical column sets


# 5. Concatenate the dataframes


# 6. Drop any duplicate columns (if needed)
#    e.g., if there was an old 'crypturl' left over, ensure it's removed


# 7. Save the final labeled dataset with unified 'url' column


# 8. Display summary
